#About

Fido is a simple Bash program that makes editing config files faster. The autocompletion script has been written so it explores the file and offers you posible configuration attributes, shows you the actual config state and then, when executed, modifies the value. 

****************************
#Install

just run "sudo ./install" and restart your terminals.
