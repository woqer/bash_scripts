NOTE: this program is still being tested, use it with caution. For now it just works with config files with '=' as separator and one line config sentences. 
	

	-usage: fido <filename> <config_attribute> <new_config_value>

Fido is a simple program that makes editing config files faster. The autocompletion script has been written so it explores the file and offers you posible configuration attributes, shows you the actual config state and then, when executed, modifies the value.
